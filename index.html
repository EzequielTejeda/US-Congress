            <div class="d-flex">
                <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                    transparency is government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart
                    of how citizens hold their public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government
                    should be transparent.<br>
                    Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public business
                    and spend taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                    good and just governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                    about what their Government is doing.<br>
                    We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the Government's
                    effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed in society,
                    and public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you to use
                    our site to become actively engaged in American government.<br>
                    TGIF works to disclose information in forms that the public can readily find and use. We solicit
                    public feedback to identify information of greatest use to the public.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                                to public opinion dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many
                                philosophes made an attack on absolutist doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their
                                intellectual project. The passage of formal legislative instruments to this end can also
                                be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which then included Finland as a
                                Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its constitution
                                (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more
                                broadly, is strongly related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public
                                sphere.<br>

                                Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                                (1789), freedom of the press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary
                                accounting and freedom of the press in constitutional articles. In the nineteenth
                                century, attempts by Metternichean statesmen to row back on these measures were
                                vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians and writers, Bentham, Mill
                                and Acton prominent among the latter.<br>

                                Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic practice
                                and is often linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian
                                countries claim to have adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the
                                origins of its modern provisions to the eighteenth century and Finland continuing the
                                presumption of openness after gaining independence in 1917, passing its Act on Publicity
                                of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new legislation in 1999).<br>

                                The United States passed its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in 1966, FOIAs, Access to
                                Information Acts (AIAs) or equivalent laws were passed in Denmark and Norway in 1970.
